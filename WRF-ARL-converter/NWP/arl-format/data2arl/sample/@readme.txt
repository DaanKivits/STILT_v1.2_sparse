./data2arl/sample					21 Dec 2000

This directory contains a sample program to generate a test 
meteorological data set in packed format.  The sample data are uniform 
in space and time, but provide a way to test the model and provide an 
outline to permit users to convert their own data into a Hysplit4 
compatible format.  The time and data subroutines need to be replaced 
with user supplied data input.
